# simple-skew
Paint.NET plugin for simple skewing/perspective.

Implemented in [CodeLab](https://boltbait.com/pdn/CodeLab/).

No anti-aliasing implemented, only simple downsampling (pixel skipping). Not appropriate for professional image processing.  
See [./example](https://github.com/RokoFox/simple-skew/tree/main/example) for examples of use and results.

Repository contains:  
Skew.cs - source code written in CodeLab  
SkewGenerated.cs - source code generated by CodeLab from Skew.cs.  
Skew.zip - build results from CodeLab
